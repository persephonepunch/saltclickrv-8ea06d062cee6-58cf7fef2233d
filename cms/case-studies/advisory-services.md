Pitfalls for dealerships and how SaltClick's advisory services can help:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dealerships, like any other businesses, can face Salesforce implementation challenges without an experienced partner who knows their industry. Some of those pitfalls include:  

1.  **Misalignment with business processes:** Without expert guidance, a dealership might set up Salesforce in a way that doesn’t mirror their sales or service processes. Our advisory services ensure the platform aligns with your business.
2.  **Data migration issues:** Moving data from old systems can be time-consuming and riddled with inaccuracy. We ca an provide guidance or solutions to ensure data integrity.
3.  **Poor user adoption:** If your staff doesn't understand or like Salesforce, they won’t use it. Our training and customization can improve user adoption rates. 
4.  **Over-customization:** While Salesforce is highly customizable, doing too much can lead to a complex system that’s hard to maintain. We can help find the right balance balance.
5.  **Lack of Integration:** Dealerships might use other systems alongside Salesforce. Without integration, efficiency is stunted. We can recommend and assist with necessary integrations.
