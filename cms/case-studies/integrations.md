**Connecting Salesforce with Your Other Tools**

Salesforce connects with most of the business software you already use. Some have built-in features that allow them to connect directly with Salesforce. For others, we use middleware to help different systems communicate and share data. And we can do custom integrations if you need a special connection to Salesforce.   
‍

**Integrations include, but are not limited to:**

*   Dealer Management Systems (DMS), like Advent and CDK
*   Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
*   Digital Retailing Tools
*   Gmail and Microsoft 365
*   Website providers
*   Advertising and marketing platforms
*   Service appointment scheduling
*   Service land tools
