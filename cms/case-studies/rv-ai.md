##### AI tools like ChatGPT are taking the world by storm, changing how businesses approach content creation and marketing strategy. [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login), by OpenAI, is a generative AI tool, lets users  enter prompts and get images and text created by artificial intelligence that sound human. There are other tools in the market, like [JasperAI](https://www.jasper.ai/) that let brands upload their style and tone to create content that sounds even more like them, but that’s a post for another time.  
  
ChatGPT gained 100 million users in just 2 months. It took TikTok 9 months to get there, showing us the incredible potential of AI in business. 

With consumers demanding personalized experiences, let’s explore how your RV dealership can use AI to create content at scale to better serve your customers.  

‍

RV dealerships can use ChatGPT to:  

-------------------------------------

*   **Automate content creation:** Blog posts, product descriptions, or email campaigns, ChatGPT can generate them quickly. Just enter a brief description or a few keywords, and the AI will craft content for you. Think of AI as the first draft. You know your brand and your customers, so it’s best to edit AI text before you publish. 

‍

**Expert tip:** The better your prompt, the better the output. Also, there are two versions of ChatGPT available. ChatGPT 3.5 only understands and interprets text input. ChatGPT 4.0 is much more advanced and can now understand and even process images. You can enter text and image prompts into ChatGPT 4, which is available through a monthly subscription. 

‍

*   **Engage customers with personalized Recommendations:** Use AI to provide personalized RV suggestions based on user behavior and preferences. You can use Salesforce to see what your customers are doing and what they’ve bought. Based on those insights, you can feed ChatGPT prompts to create personalized for them.  
      
    **For example:** Let’s say a known prospect Amy is looking for a new camper van. She’s looking for one that sleeps 4. She’s browsed a bunch of Class Bs and keeps clicking on one that’s under $160,000. 

Knowing that, your sales reps can proactively reach out to Amy with personalized messaging. Ask her if she has questions or wants to see more videos of the interior. You can use ChatGPT to formulate the first draft of that message. 

‍

The more detailed your prompt the better. If you have a particular tone or style, include that in your prompt. That green G you see next to the purple arrow, is a Grammarly plug-in. 

‍

Grammarly checks your writing for spelling and grammar mistakes. You can also use it to generate text, but it’s not as comprehensive as ChatGPT 4. However, since it works in multiple apps, like social media, emails, and other digital platforms, if your team writes a lot, it may be a good investment. 

‍

![ChatGPT email prompt example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/654259ce2bbac66528e22269/654259ce2bbac66528e22366_7gnevdNCzxmIhhNlL6u8sy7pTA7RaR1_iqsHAclw1HzGcVSi1JGB2B2qDcZExcg5nYWnHpsSmHgpqLX1MdY4k63OyHMk0isHOhrg6ogXJ44ryRNM79YmHb-vbtRys8fM2ZpBYjBhqm83Ayab64av1N4.png)

Here you see the email generated by ChatGPT 4. If you’re generally happy with it, you can use this draft and tailor it to your voice. If you’re not happy with it, you can hit Regenerate to see a second version of the email. Or, start over with a different prompt.  

  

*   **FAQs & customer support:** Automatically answer commonly asked questions about RVs, maintenance, financing, and more. Comb through service calls, interview sales reps, and document customer questions as you get them. Next, you can enter the answer in ChatGPT and expand on it or rephrase it. 

‍

If you’re stuck on FAQ, you can ask ChatGPT to generate some.

If these questions aren’t right, they may inspire you to think of others that are more aligned with your dealership and customers. Worst case scenario, you try a different prompt and include keywords and other text to enrich the response you receive. 

  

How to prompt ChatGPT to get more relevant content for your RV dealership
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   **Be specific:** The more detailed your prompts, the more targeted the output. Instead of "Tell me about RVs," try "Discuss the benefits of Class A RVs for families."
*   **Iterative feedback:** If the first answer isn't perfect, refine your question or ask the AI to elaborate.
*   **Use templates:** If you have a preferred content style, create a template and ask ChatGPT to fill in the gaps.

Where to use ChatGPT to create a winning RV dealership content strategy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

For RV dealerships, content can play a dual role: driving sales and building a lifestyle brand. Catering to a diverse omnichannel customer base necessitates a solid content strategy that both informs and engages. Let’s explore how AI can help with these areas:

### Content for Sales

#### 1\. Product Listings

**Description:** Detailed specifications and features of each RV model, highlighting their unique selling points.

**Photos & Videos:** High-quality visuals showcasing the RV's interior and exterior.

#### 2\. Promotional Content

**Seasonal Sales:** Announcements for end-of-season sales, holiday discounts, and special promotions.

**Testimonials & Reviews:** Showcase real customer experiences to build trust.

#### 3\. Comparison Guides

**Model Comparisons**: Side-by-side comparisons of different RV models or brands to help customers make informed decisions.

#### 4\. Financing & Trade-In Information

**Financing Options:** Details about loan terms, down payments, interest rates, and monthly installments.

**Trade-In Procedures:** Information about how customers can trade in their old RVs for newer models.

#### 5\. FAQs

**Purchasing Queries:** Address common questions about purchasing, financing, warranties, and more.

‍

### Content for Lifestyle Branding (for diverse omnichannel customers):

‍

#### 1\. Lifestyle Blogs & Articles

**Travel Stories:** Share experiences of people traveling in their RVs, emphasizing the freedom and adventure it brings.

**RV Tips:** Maintenance, decoration, and hacks to improve the RVing experience.

‍

#### 2\. Social Media Content

**User-Generated Content:** Encourage customers to share their travel stories, photos, and videos.

**Live Sessions:** Host live sessions showcasing new RV models, Q&A sessions, or interviews with seasoned RV travelers.

‍

#### 3\. Email Newsletters

**Monthly Round-ups:** Latest articles, top RV destinations, customer reviews, etc.

**Exclusive Offers:** Special deals or early bird discounts exclusive to subscribers.

‍

#### 4\. Video Content

**Tutorials:** How-to guides on RV maintenance, setting up camp, or using specific RV features.

**Documentaries:** Short documentaries or web series focusing on the RV lifestyle, perhaps showcasing a cross-country journey or a family's RV adventures.

‍

#### 5\. Interactive Content

**Quizzes:** "Which RV is right for you?" or "What's your ideal RV destination?" 

‍

Quizzes are great for lead generation and can convert anonymous shoppers into known prospects. Using Experience Cloud, our team built a calculator in Salesforce that collected information about prospects shopping for mortgages and routed them to the right sales reps, who were armed with all the information they needed to make a valuable first impression. 

‍

**Webinars & Livestreams:** Covering topics like "Getting Started with RVing" or "Top RV Destinations for 2023."

  
Shoppers will often turn to YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok for videos. It’s important that your RV dealership is reflected.

#### 6\. Diverse Representation

‍

**Inclusive Marketing:** Showcase diverse groups of people enjoying the RV lifestyle, ensuring representation across age, race, gender, and more.

**Localized Content:** For different regions or countries, create content that resonates with local cultures and preferences.

‍

#### 7\. Collaborations & Partnerships

**Brand Collaborations:** Collaborate with travel, outdoor, or camping brands to showcase a holistic RV lifestyle.

**Guest Posts:** Invite prominent RV influencers or travel enthusiasts to contribute to your blog or social channels.

‍

For RV dealerships, content is not just about driving immediate sales but also about cultivating a community around the RV lifestyle. By using different content types for sales and lifestyle branding, RV dealerships can appeal to diverse omnichannel customers and sustain engagement and loyalty.
