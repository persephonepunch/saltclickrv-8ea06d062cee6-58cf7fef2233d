Salesforce Customization
------------------------

Salesforce customization means modifying Salesforce features, functionalities, and user interfaces to match specific business needs and processes beyond the platform's out-of-the-box configurations.

What does customization include?
--------------------------------

User interface changes: Tailoring the look and feel of Salesforce to provide dealership staff with a more intuitive or familiar experience.

Adding new fields and objects: Creating new database fields or entirely new objects to capture dealership-specific data.

Workflows and process automation: Designing and implementing automated processes to mirror your dealership's unique processes.

Integration with other systems: Connecting Salesforce with other business software such as dealer management systems, inventory platform, email providers like Gmail, and more gives you even more visibility into your business and customers.

Apex Code Development: Writing custom code for more intricate requirements that can't be achieved through configuration.

Lightning Component Development: Creating custom pages, components, and visual experiences.

### Examples of what can be customized:

**Custom dashboards:** Tailored dashboards to provide dealership specific insights at a glance.

**Role-specific views:** Configuring unique layouts for different roles.

**Custom approval processes:** Designing a multi-step process that aligns with your dealership's operations.

**Custom reports:** Generating reports that cater to your business's needs and the metrics that matter to you.

**Custom Mobile Experience:** Adapting Salesforce mobile views for  field operations.

Why is Salesforce customization needed?
---------------------------------------

Business differentiation: Every dealership has unique needs and processes, which standard Salesforce functionalities may only sometimes meet. Our job is to ensure you don't over customize, so you don't get a solution that's hard to maintain or understand.

**Efficiency:** Streamlining operations and reducing manual tasks.

**Integrations:** Ensuring Salesforce works seamlessly with other critical dealership systems.

**User Adoption:** A more tailored system can increase user satisfaction and adoption rates.

Poorly implemented customizations can degrade system performance. And a heavy reliance on custom code can lead to dependence on specific developers or teams. That's where SaltClick comes in.
