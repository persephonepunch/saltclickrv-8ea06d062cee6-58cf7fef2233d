**Grounds for Processing Personal Data**

1.  We will not process your Personal Data without your consent, unless we are permitted or required to do so by applicable law. Your consent may be express or implied. Express consent is when you willingly agree (e.g., orally, in writing, or electronic agreement) to the processing of your Personal Data for particular purposes. Implied consent is when: (a) you do not expressly give consent, but you rather volunteer Personal Data for obvious purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances; or (b) you are given notice and a reasonable opportunity to opt-out of your Personal Data being processed for specified purposes, and you do not opt-out.

**Disclosure of Personal Data**

1.  General. We do not disclose, sell or otherwise transfer your Personal Data to any third parties, except as set out in this Privacy Policy. Anytime we disclose your Personal Data to third parties, we take reasonable measures to ensure that the rules set forth in this Privacy Policy are complied with and these third parties provide contractual guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection laws. We minimize the amount of Personal Data we disclose to what is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish the specified purpose.
2.  Service Providers. We may provide your Personal Data to third party service providers in order to help us achieve the Purposes and operate our Site. For example, we may use third party service providers to help us analyze usage of our Site, track the effectiveness of our marketing strategies and communications, provide email services, assist with the prevention, detection, mitigation and investigation of potentially illegal acts and/or security breaches, collect and process error and crash reports, host web servers and store data. These third parties are authorized to use your Personal Data only as necessary to provide these services to us.
3.  Corporate Transactions. We may also disclose or transfer your Personal Data to affiliates or third parties in the event of a proposed reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or equity, subject in each case to customary confidentiality agreements.
4.  Legal Disclosure. We may disclose Personal Data if we reasonably believe disclosure is in accordance with or required by any applicable law, regulation or legal process. This includes, without limitation, the disclosure of Personal Data where necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, or as otherwise permitted by applicable law. You hereby release SaltClick of any liability associated with any such disclosures made in good faith.
5.  International Transfer and Storage. Your Personal Data may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage third party service providers. By using our Site and otherwise providing us your Personal Data, you consent to the transfer of your Personal Data to countries outside of your country of residence, which may have different data protection rules than in your country. While such information is outside of Canada, it is subject to the laws of the country in which it is held, and may be subject to disclosure to the governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of such other country, pursuant to the laws of such country.

**Retention of Personal Data**

1.  If we use Personal Data to make a decision that directly affects you, we will retain that Personal Data for at least one year, so that you have a reasonable opportunity to request access to it. Subject to the foregoing, we will retain your Personal Data only as long as necessary to fulfill the Purposes and to comply with applicable law. We will delete or anonymize the Personal Data once it is no longer necessary for us to hold it. We are not responsible for any liability or loss you experience as a result of our disposal of Personal Data.

**Security of Personal Data**

1.  We protect your Personal Data using security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration. Such measures include using SSL secure protocol to encrypt communications. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We encourage you to also take steps to protect Personal Data by, for example, closing all web browsers after using the Site.
2.  **Rights Relating to Processing Personal Data**
3.  You have certain rights relating to your Personal Data, subject to applicable law:
